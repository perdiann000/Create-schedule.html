    <h1 style="color:red">My first Website</h1>
    <p style="color:green">Hello World! This is my first webite.
    <p>Here is another paragraph of text

    <h2>a Subsection title here</h2>
   <p style="color:blue">And here is another paragraph.
    Notice that spacing doesn't really matter.
    Everything is printed on one line on the page.
    Even though in the code, these are all separate lines.
    <p>If you want a new line, you need to use another paragraph tag.
