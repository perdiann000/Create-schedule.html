  <h1 style="color:red">What is Uncle Grandpa?</h1>

  <div id="example1"><p>Uncle Grandpa is a cartoon created by Peter Browngardt, which is one of my favorite shows of all time. But unfortunately,
not a lot of people bother to watch it, mostly because they find it too weird compared to other animated programs. But the thing is,
that's what its intending to, to BE weird. It has that style of old wacky 90's cartoons like <i>Cow and Chicken</i> and <i>Ren and Stimpy</i>.</p>
  <p>Just remember, you can't judge a book by its over, even if you think it looks weird on the outside. It's what the thing behind it counts.</p>
  <p>I figured that because not too many people are familiar with the show, or at least not know too much about it, I decided to make a website for it,
    since I have plenty of knowledge on it. And guess what, remember when I said it had that 90's style? Well this project's perfect for it!</div>
