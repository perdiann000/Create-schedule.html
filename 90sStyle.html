  <title>All about Uncle Grandpa!</title>

  <div class="a"><h1 style="color:red">What is Uncle Grandpa?</h1></div>

  <div class="a" id="example1"><p>Uncle Grandpa is a cartoon created by Peter Browngardt, which is one of my favorite shows of all time. But unfortunately,
not a lot of people bother to watch it, mostly because they find it too weird compared to other animated programs. But the thing is,
that's what its intending to, to BE weird. It has that style of old wacky 90's cartoons like <i>Cow and Chicken</i> and <i>Ren and Stimpy</i>.</p>
  <p>Just remember, you can't judge a book by its over, even if you think it looks weird on the outside. It's what the thing behind it counts.</p>
  <p>I figured that because not too many people are familiar with the show, or at least not know too much about it, I decided to make a website for it,
    since I have plenty of knowledge on it. And guess what, remember when I said it had that 90's style? Well this project's perfect for it!</div>

  <div class="a"><h2>Uncle Grandpa</h2>
  <p>Uncle Grandpa is the main protoganist of the show, hence why the show is named after him. He goes around helping kids with their problems.
    But he helps them by taking them to crazy adventures instead of doing the easier way. However he also teaches them lessons throughout the journey to overcome their problems.</p></div>
