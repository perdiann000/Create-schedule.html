  <title>90's Cartoons</title>

  <div class="a"><h1 style="color:orange">The Golden Age of Cartoons?</h1></div>

  <div class="a" id="example1"><p class="a">Most of us definitely watched cartoons as a kid, but there's still a vast majority of older people
    who still watch them. Just because they're animated doesn't mean older people can't enjoy them. But I'd say the 90's was a real golden age of cartoons.
    Sorry Disney, I love your movies and shows but to me they lack something what older cartoons (Mostly Cartoon Network) shows had.</p></div>
